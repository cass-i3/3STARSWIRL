                <div class="flexbox"><p>
                    At 3STARSWIRL INC., we are committed to fostering a safer and more unified society. Through innovative technology and strategic collaboration with law enforcement, we identify individuals who pose potential risks but remain unaccounted for in official systems. Our mission is to bridge these gaps, ensuring public safety is upheld and communities can thrive securely.

                    This proactive approach reflects our dedication to maintaining order and trust in the systems we serve. By addressing risks with precision and discretion, we work tirelessly to create a future where safety is paramount.

                <div class="flexbox"><p>
                    To realize this vision, we are implementing a district-based operational model across Tokyo. This plan ensures efficiency, precision, and a focused presence in every community. Each district will include:<br />
                </p></div>
                <ul class="ex">
                    <li>A 3STARSWIRL Corporate Office, managing regional operations and administrative oversight.
                    </li>
                    <li>Multiple 3STAR SecuroStations™, serving as security and operations hubs to monitor and respond to regional needs.</li>
                    <li>Supply Stations, providing essential resources to support the district's operations and infrastructure.
                    </li>
                </ul><br />
                <div class="flexbox"><p>
                    Additionally, security checkpoints will be established in high-traffic and critical areas, such as train stations, major shopping centers, business districts, and district border crossings. These checkpoints are designed to enhance safety and maintain a secure environment for all residents and visitors.

                <div class="flexbox"><p>
                    Our initiatives are set to launch with a structured timeline to ensure success at every stage:
                </p></div>
                <div class="ex">
                    <ol>
                        <li>2026: Comprehensive planning and strategy development commence, including logistics, infrastructure design, and collaboration with government entities.
                        </li>
                        <li>2027: Early testing and pilot programs will begin, with select districts in Tokyo chosen as prototypes for the full rollout.</li>
                        <li>Mid-2028 to Early 2029: Implementation reaches its busiest period as the majority of infrastructure and operations are finalized.</li>
                        <li>Q3 2029: Full deployment across Tokyo is completed, marking the successful realization of our vision for a safer, more organized urban landscape.</li>

                <div class="flexbox"><p>
                    Importantly, this phased approach will incur no additional costs to the government, aside from existing agreements. This ensures a seamless partnership that prioritizes efficiency and public trust.
